# Bounded retry for a single DNS lookup.
#
# Why: the authoritative health monitors fire ~24 back-to-back queries and treat
# any single non-zero dig exit as a hard failure. Observed 2026-07-21 on the
# secondary (81.15.150.159): isolated names timed out on one run and answered
# immediately on the next, while the zone was demonstrably fine (same SOA serial
# as the primary, 8/8 on retry). That produced false OnFailure alerts, which is
# worse than useless -- it trains operators to ignore the monitor.
#
# Retry the individual lookup, not the whole monitor, so one slow packet cannot
# mask or duplicate unrelated results. A genuine outage still fails: every
# attempt has to fail, and the attempt count is reported so a "passed on retry
# 3" service does not look identical to a healthy one.
